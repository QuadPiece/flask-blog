Flask blog
==========

Personal blog written using the Flask microframework.

# Goals

This project was started to learn some basic Flask and Python features that could come in handy later. Mainly, these features are:

* Using markdown
* Handling files
* Templating
* Some lazy single-user login just to test the session feature
* Not sure if DB (prolly just SQLite) or static files
* Getting used to route-based web development
* Maybe some JSON stuff
* Maybe some Self-written caching in Python

**Warning, most of the Python code will probably end up being written in a single, messy file. Call me old school or stupid, but "ctrl+f"-ing for the route I want to work on is just how I tend to go about these things**
